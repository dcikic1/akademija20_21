Adventureland is one of the "themed lands" at the many Disneyland-style theme parks
run by the Walt Disney Company around the world.
It is themed to resemble the remote jungles in Africa, Asia, South America, the South Pacific and the Caribbean.
"To create a land that would make this dream reality", said Walt Disney,
"We pictured ourselves far from civilization, in the remote jungles of Asia and Africa."
